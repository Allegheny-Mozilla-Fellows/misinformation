# How to contribute

Here are some important resources:

  * Email: Dr. Bonham-Carter (obonhamcarter@allegheny.edu), or Declan Casey (caseyd@allegheny.edu).
  * Bugs? Use the GitHub Issue Tracker, unless the issue is security realted, in  which case email either of the two people above.
  * IRC: chat.freenode.net channel [#opengovernment](irc://chat.freenode.net/opengovernment). We're usually there during business hours.

## Testing

We only have a handful of R functions. Please write examples for new code you create.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to misinformation](https://github.com/Allegheny-Mozilla-Fellows/misinformation) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://github.com/Allegheny-Mozilla-Fellows/misinformation/blob/master/pull_request_template.md)). Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of MisInfoBot will generally not be accepted.
