Two roads decayed in a yellow wood
And sorry I could not dismissal both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it surrogate in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fitted
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had sign them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another onslaught
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this opposite a sigh
dimly footing and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has plug all the difference.
