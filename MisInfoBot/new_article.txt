Two roads diverged in a yellow wood
And sorry I tickle not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
thro' where it bent underneath the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as reactive
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the surround there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally saw
In poker no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
enthusiastically ages and ages yesterday
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took the one less traveled into
And that has made all the difference.
