Make sure to install the necessary packages and load the necessary libraries before running the code. There are 2 user defined variables in the code, 'url' and 'iterations'; 'url' should be a link to New York Times article that is copy and pasted from the search bar and pasted in between the parentheses, and the 'iterations' variable is a number that determines how many changes will be made to the article


There is another script called "MisInfoBot_demo.R" that show can be used for demonstration purposes. In a classroom setting, it would be tedious to  use a New York Times Article and go through the entire piece searching for small changes, so this demonstration code uses a smaller sample size so that the changes being made are much more visible.

Before running the code, keep in mind the real-world application of the code and answer the following questions in about a short paragraph: How many times is a new story likely to be recycled? What type of information is likely to be changed, whether through honest mistakes from reporters or intentionally?

Declare the variables for the URL you would like to parse and the amount of changes you would like to be made.

Now that you've done some analysis on an article given to you, you're going to do some analysis on a New York Times article of your choosing. Make sure the article is about a topic you are very familiar with, whether a sports article about LeBron James' high school career, a tech article about the specs for the new MacBook, or an article on the newest Quentin Tarantino movie. However, do not yet read this article. You are going to follow the same process as you did for the article given to you. You will first choose the amount of changes you want to make using the 'iterations' variable, but consider the length of the article this time; how many changes would make the mutations far too obvious? For example, if the article is only five paragraphs long then 100 changes might be too obvious. Since it is an article about a topic you already know well, try and trick yourself. Maybe start with a low number of changes, say 2-6 for each paragraph (meaning anywhere from 10 to 35 changes in a 5 paragraph article) and working up from there. Now read the newly mutated article and answer the second question in blue. Then read the original article and answer the third question in blue.
