# we use readtext() to takea a file or fileset from disk or a URL, and returns a type of data.frame
# that can be used directly with the corpus() constructor function, to create a quanteda corpus object
# readtext() works on text (.txt) files, comma-separated-value (.csv) files, XML formatted data, data
# from the Facebook API, in JSON format, data from the Twitter API, in JSON format, and generic JSON
# data.
