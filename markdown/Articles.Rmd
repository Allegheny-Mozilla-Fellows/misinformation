```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


I assume using the format below should help me print the newly changed sentences, but is it possible to import code from another place and then print the paragraphs here?

According to calvin.edu: 'If you run R code in the console or the RStudio GUI (for example, reading in a data set by pasting code into the console or using the Import Dataset button in the Environment tab), you wonâ€™t be able to use the results in your markdown file. Any and all commands you need, including reading in data, need to be included in the file.'

```{r}
library(tibble)
# Text scraped from somewhere and placed into the variable "character_variable"
character_variable <- "this is a character variable"
character_variable <- as_tibble(character_variable)
```
This is the text I have scraped: `r character_variable$value`.
